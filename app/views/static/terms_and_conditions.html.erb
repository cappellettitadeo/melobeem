  <h4>Dos and Don&apos;ts</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Do use your common sense. We want the area to be an engaging and
      enjoyable place. We want to help ensure you behave reasonably and
      sensibly. What is - or is not - acceptable is usually a matter of
      common sense.
    </li>
    <li>
      Do remember that this area is moderated in part only and that we do
      not pre-screen material before it is posted. Moderators will help
      moderate and manage real-time discussion and we will run regular
      checks of user submissions in addition, but sometimes submissions
      are made that are inappropriate. As in any community we need your
      assistance to control this issue.
    </li>
    <li>
      Do respect other users. Lots of us have strong beliefs about many
      things. That doesn&apos;t mean we can&apos;t agree to disagree.
      Please remember that others have a right to an opinion that may
      differ from yours.
    </li>
    <li>
      Do report any comments, posts, videos, photographs or anything else
      in this area (or elsewhere on the Website) which breach these rules
      or offend you or make you feel uncomfortable. Without your help in
      reporting objectionable content or other inappropriate submissions
      and behaviour, the area won&apos;t work as well. Please provide as
      much relevant information as you can. We will always treat reports
      seriously and, where appropriate, in confidence. We also provide
      links to outside agencies and authorities, but in most circumstances
      you should report the submission to us in the first instance.
    </li>
    <li>
      Do remember that we reserve the right to use, delete, edit, move and
      merge your submissions without telling you and that our (or our
      moderators) decisions are final.
    </li>
    <li>
      Do submit your comments in English. This helps us to check that the
      submission is appropriate.
    </li>
    <li>
      Do check these rules regularly as we may need to change them and
      please be aware that additional usage terms may also apply and these
      will be marked on the relevant part of the Website.
    </li>
    <li>
      Don&apos;t engage in personal abuse or express any kind of hatred
      towards any group because of their religious, racial, ethnic origin,
      sexual orientation, gender, age or disability. Discuss the points
      made intelligently in a submission, not directly towards the person
      putting it forward.
    </li>
    <li>
      Don&apos;t make any submissions which are obscene or may be
      considered to be offensive, or illegal or to promote illegal or
      inappropriate behaviour.

      Don&apos;t use the area in a manner that interferes with, or

      deceptive postings.
    </li>
    <li>

      that such off-topic submissions are allowed in a particular area of
      the Website.
    </li>
    <li>
      Don&apos;t submit libellous or defamatory remarks. That means not
      submitting anything which you can&apos;t prove to be true and which
      might damage someone&apos;s reputation.
    </li>
    <li>
      Don&apos;t post comments about people&apos;s private lives or any
      matter which is the subject of on-going legal proceedings. If in
