          came are automatically collected. Using your IP address to help us
          identify you and to gather broad demographic information about you and

          cookies to monitor your experiences with our web site and to keep
          track of your purchases and other activities. Cookies also enable us

          and, if you choose, to save other personal and financial information

          Most browsers will provide assistance to enable you to disable cookies
          if you wish, but that may also disable your access to certain areas of
          our web site, so we do not recommend that you disable cookies.

        <h4>Cookies policy</h4>

        <p>
          When we provide services, we want to make them easy, useful and
          reliable. Where services are delivered on the internet, this sometimes
          involves placing small amounts of information on your device, for
          example, computer or mobile phone. These include small text files
          known as cookies. They cannot be used to identify you personally,
          cannot carry viruses, or install malware.

          <b>What is a cookie?</b>

        <p>
          A cookie is a piece of data sent to your device from a website. This
          means the website can recognise your device if you return to the same
          website. Cookies do not contain any personal information about you and
          cannot be used to identify an individual user. A cookie often includes
          a unique identifier, which is an anonymous number (randomly generated)
          and is stored on your device. Some expire at the end of your website
          session; others remain on your computer for longer.
        </p>

        <p>

            give the same information several times during one task, e.g.
            filling out a web form or a web survey
          </li>
          <li>
            recognising that you may already have given a username and password
            so you don&apos;t need to do it for every web page
          </li>
          <li>
            measuring how many people are using services, so they can be made
            easier to use and there&apos;s enough capacity to ensure they are
